# AlphaChannel

[![ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/img/githubbutton_sm.svg)](https://ko-fi.com/alphachannel)

A Dalamud plugin that renders a real, movable video screen in the world and keeps it in sync
across everyone watching, so you and your friends can watch something together in-game.

Not a mod-sync overlay and not a screen-share - the video actually plays for everyone
independently, driven by a small self-hosted relay server that just passes playback state (URL,
position, pause/play, screen position) between clients.

## Install

Add this as a custom plugin repository in-game:

1. `/xlsettings` -> Experimental -> Custom Plugin Repositories
2. Paste: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vinney491-dotcom/AlphaChannel/master/pluginmaster.json`
3. Add, then find **AlphaChannel** under Available Plugins in the normal plugin installer and
   install it like any other plugin.

No account, no sign-up - the plugin generates its own local identity on first run and connects to
the relay automatically. The first time you load it on a given character, you'll be asked to pick
a display name (defaults to your character name).

## Using it

- `/achannel` opens the window.
- Paste a video URL (or search YouTube, or check whether a Twitch channel is live, right from the
  Discover tab) and hit Play now.
- Age-restricted YouTube videos need a signed-in cookie - see "Age-restricted video settings" on
  the Discover tab (can read straight from a logged-in Firefox session, or point it at a
  `cookies.txt` you exported yourself).
- Drag the screen into position with the Screen controls, save it as a named preset if you want to
  reuse that spot later. The power button next to playback controls fully closes the in-world
  screen when you're done.
- **Watch-along / DJ floor**: right-click a friend who's also running AlphaChannel and choose
  *Join Stream*, or type `/achannel watch <name>` — the screen joins for AlphaChannel users.
  Whoever's hosting can hand control to a viewer ("Make host") and can copy a party-chat invite.
  Rename anytime from the Rename control next to connection status.
- The video auto-pauses if the host enters combat or a cutscene, and resumes after.
- Send quick emoji reactions during a watch-along - they fly up across the in-world screen for
  everyone watching, not just your own window.
- The queue auto-plays: adding something to an empty queue starts it immediately.

## Features

- In-world video screen (YouTube, Twitch, and most direct video URLs), with volume, seek, and a
  queue with thumbnails you can reorder
- In-plugin YouTube search and Twitch live-channel check
- Cookie-based sign-in for age-restricted YouTube videos
- Real-time watch-along sync over a self-hosted relay - join by name, no accounts
- See who's watching, hand off hosting to another viewer, and rename yourself anytime
- Auto-pause during combat/cutscenes
- Emoji reactions that animate on the in-world screen itself
- Saveable screen position presets

## Self-hosting the relay

The plugin talks to a small ASP.NET Core relay (`src/AlphaChannel.Server`) over WebSockets. To run
your own instead of relying on someone else's:

```
cp .env.example .env   # set RELAY_DOMAIN to a domain pointed at your server, and a random ADMIN_TOKEN
docker compose up -d --build
```

This brings up the relay behind Caddy, which handles TLS automatically for `RELAY_DOMAIN`. The
plugin's default relay address is set in `Configuration.cs` (`RelayServerUrl`) - point your own
build at your own relay by changing that before building, or add a settings UI for it if you want
that configurable at runtime (v1 deliberately hides this from players so they don't need to know
or type a server address).

The relay has no real authentication - see the code comments in `UserDirectory.cs` and
`ConnectionHandler.cs` for the details. Fine for a small trusted group; not meant to be a
public-internet-safe auth story as-is.

## Building

Requires the .NET 10 SDK and a Dalamud dev environment (`DALAMUD_HOME` set, or the default XIVLauncher
install location).

```
dotnet build AlphaChannel.slnx
```

`src/AlphaChannel.Plugin` is the Dalamud plugin, `src/AlphaChannel.Server` is the relay,
`src/AlphaChannel.Contracts` is the shared wire-format library both depend on.

## Tile icons (Tabler stencils)

Home / Apps tiles use white-on-transparent PNGs under `src/AlphaChannel.Plugin/Assets/Icons/`,
generated from Tabler Icons and tinted at draw time (same idea as Aetherphone).

```
cd tools/icon-generator && npm install && npm run build
```

See `docs/ART-ASSET-SPEC.md`. To continue this work in Cursor Desktop, paste
`CURSOR-DESKTOP-HANDOFF.md` (repo root) into a new chat.
